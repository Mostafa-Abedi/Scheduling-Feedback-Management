# Scheduling Feedback Management

## Introduction
We have identified a problem commonly faced by university students, in which the student body does not have access or authority to send feedback regarding issues centered around course scheduling. Problems with scheduling can include but are not limited to: overcrowding or under crowding in rooms, available times scheduled too late at night, and conflicting time slots. The lack of available communication lines from students to the scheduling committees creates frustrations among the student body, and the purpose of this project is to ease this frustration by creating a platform where students can submit their feedback, and the scheduling team of the university can manage the submissions from students. Since the goal is to reduce frustration and increase communication, a simple layout and ease of use should be a top priority on this project. Our project is for students to voice their concerns about scheduling, and our software will prioritize their complaints and suggestions based on the number of students with the same concern.

## Objectives
- Create a portal where students and scheduling managers can communicate
- Website should allow students to submit feedback (complaints and/or suggestions) to the scheduling team
- Website should allow the scheduling team to view and manage feedback from students
- Website should have a clear layout that is intuitive to understand and navigate
- Project planning for the website should be complete by the end of the 2024 Winter semester
- Website should allow the scheduling team to design and implement a solution to a problem based on student feedback

## Success Criteria
- If students are actively using the system, and receiving responses
- If the scheduling team can successfully commit five productive changes to the schedule with minimal complications
- If the Website reduces repetition of reported complaints received by the scheduling team
- If the Website reportedly improves organization among the scheduling team
- Project planning is successfully completed within the specified time frame, and project construction is reasonably finished within a year

## Infrastructure Requirements
- Our software is built upon the current scheduling system used by the institution, and therefore needs access to the school's complete schedule (master schedule).
- The software should access the student registration system and recognize the faculty members as managers or administrators.
- The software must have permission from the institution to commit and/or to permanent changes to the master schedule.
- A cloud server is required to hold the user's input and information.
- Entries from users should have a 6-month lifespan before being automatically discarded to optimize limits on memory
- Server capacity should allow at least 50% of the student body to have concurrent connections simultaneously.
